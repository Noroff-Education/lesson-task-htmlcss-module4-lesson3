# HTML and CSS Module 4

## Task 3

### Brief

In this task you will re-factor your CSS file to make it easier to manage and maintain.

By the end of the task you should have:

- Changed the background-image to use the 'background' shorthand, reducing the lines needed. Hint: [description of 'background' on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background)
- Reduced the number of times "width: 100%" is set on images
- Broken the CSS file into multiple CSS files for each page (note: consider your media queries)
- Created an imports folder with a stylesheet for the site links, and a stylesheet for CSS Variables.
- Made CSS Variables for the heading font, the paragraph font, and the grey color used in the header and footer.
- Changed 'grid-gap' to the latest specification of 'gap'

Note: the website shouldn't change in appearance, but the styles should become easier to follow and edit.
